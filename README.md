# Note Taker 

As a developer, I want to create an application that helps users be able to jot downn notes using an Express.js back end and will save + retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The Note Taker is openps with a landing page with a link to a notes page. After that, the user will be presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and then when I enter a new note title and the note’s text. An icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page to save and the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.

The application should have a db.json file on the back end that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the fs module.

Mock-Up
The following images show the web application's appearance and functionality:
